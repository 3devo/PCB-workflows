  # The diff outputs require the check_zone_fills preflight (which
  # forces a zone fill, it does not actually check anything).
  # Defining it here prevents overriding it from the project config.
  check_zone_fills: true

# For checking zone fills, this defines diff outputs that diff the
# current file on-disk against the loaded file, and fails if it finds
# (significant) differences.  Because the loaded file has been zone
# filled by kibot, this essentially fails when the commit was made with
# outdated zone fills, so it can be used as a sanity check for commits.
#
# This is a bit of a roundabout way, but it works well enough. See also
